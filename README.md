# Welcome to the Delft Digital Humanities Community Discussion page!

Head over to the "Discussions" tab on the top to join a discussion or create a new topic. A suggestion is to use tags (the @ symbol followed by the person's username with whom you want to connect) so that you can more easily continue conversations and invite others to join. 

Feel free to introduce yourself and why you are a part of this awesome community! :)
